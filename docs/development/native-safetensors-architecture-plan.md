# Native safetensors architecture bridge

Status: implementation in progress. The tensor-source interface is internal and is not a stable public API.

## 1. Objective

Native safetensors loading should be a source-format adapter, not a second model implementation.

For an architecture already supported through GGUF, adding safetensors support should normally require:

1. mapping Hugging Face configuration fields into the existing llama.cpp model metadata;
2. mapping canonical runtime tensor names to source tensor names;
3. declaring the small number of architecture-specific layout transforms; and
4. selecting an already-supported quantization adapter.

The existing model class must remain the authority for tensor topology and graph construction. Existing CPU, CUDA, HIP, split/offload, VBR, speculative-decoding, and graph-fusion paths should be reused rather than reimplemented in a safetensors importer.

New backend kernels should only be needed for a genuinely new numerical format or operation, not because weights arrived in a safetensors container.

## 2. Current state

The first implementation already reuses the runtime after import:

```text
safetensors directory
    -> safetensors registry and quantization-config parser
    -> metadata-only compatibility GGUF plus registered architecture importer
    -> internal llama_model_tensor_source
    -> existing llama_model_qwen35 tensor creation and graph
    -> existing ggml backend dispatch
```

### Already generic

- Safetensors shard discovery, header parsing, dtype/shape validation, bounds checks, and tensor reads.
- Ordered compressed-tensors rule matching.
- The callback-backed `llama_model_loader` path.
- Device placement and backend-buffer selection after a runtime tensor has been described.
- Backend dispatch by ggml operation, tensor type, shape, and layout.
- The existing Qwen3.5 model graph and its optimized kernels.

### Still coupled to Qwen3.5

- Only one architecture importer is registered so far (Qwen3.5), but selection
  now goes through an ambiguity-checking importer registry.
- The importer manually constructs Qwen-specific GGUF model keys; tokenizer,
  sampling, RoPE parsing, and metadata storage are shared helpers.
- Canonical-to-source name mapping, plain-tensor dtype conversion, and Qwen-specific
  permutations are still mixed in one file. Quant-format binding and validation
  now live in a reusable adapter.
- Model validation is fixed to one Qwen3.5 geometry.
- The quantization, architecture, and metadata seams are separated. Explicit
  transform objects and shared ordinary-tensor naming remain before
  architecture two is cheap.

The duplicated target manifest has been removed. The next structural target is
extracting reusable naming and transform helpers so a second architecture does
not copy Qwen-specific importer machinery.

## 3. Required invariants

These are design constraints, not optional cleanup goals.

1. **One graph implementation.** Safetensors and GGUF for one architecture use the same `llama_model_*` implementation and build the same logical graph.
2. **One tensor-topology authority.** `load_arch_tensors()` and its calls to `create_tensor()` define which runtime tensors exist. An importer must not maintain a second complete target list.
3. **Canonical runtime tensors.** Once admitted, a source tensor has an ordinary canonical llama.cpp name, ggml type, shape, strides, and quantization auxiliaries. Backends must not branch on the original container format.
4. **Quantization is architecture-independent where possible.** FP8 block, FP8 channel, NVFP4, W8A8, AWQ, and GPTQ contracts belong to reusable quant adapters.
5. **Architecture transforms are explicit.** Row/column permutations, offset norms, recurrent-state conventions, and fused source projections remain in the architecture adapter.
6. **No hidden conversion of the whole model.** Loading may transform one destination tensor at a time. It must not create a complete temporary GGUF or a second resident copy of the model.
7. **Backend capability is checked before expensive allocation.** Unsupported type/backend combinations fail with a precise message or use an explicitly supported fallback.
8. **Source files remain read-only.** Repacking occurs in bounded host staging or directly into the selected destination buffer.
9. **The GGUF path does not regress.** The new source abstraction must add no work to ordinary GGUF loading or inference after construction.
10. **Failure is strict.** Missing scales, ambiguous name mappings, unsupported zero points, shape mismatches, and unconsumed required quantized tensors are errors rather than silent coercions.

## 4. Target architecture

### 4.1 Generic tensor-source seam

Introduce an internal source interface usable by both the existing GGUF path and callback-backed sources. Exact names can change during implementation, but the responsibilities should resemble:

```cpp
struct llama_source_tensor_desc {
    ggml_type type;
    std::array<int64_t, GGML_MAX_DIMS> ne;
};

class llama_tensor_source {
public:
    virtual bool describe(
        const std::string & canonical_name,
        llama_source_tensor_desc & out) const = 0;

    virtual void load(
        const std::string & canonical_name,
        ggml_tensor & destination) const = 0;

    virtual void validate_complete() const = 0;
    virtual ~llama_tensor_source() = default;
};
```

`llama_model_loader::create_tensor()` must ask the source for type and source-described dimensions when a virtual source is active. This replaces the current requirement that every tensor first be inserted into synthetic GGUF tensor metadata.

The existing model's requested dimensions remain an independent check. A source description does not get to redefine the architecture silently.

`get_tensor_info()` must use the same source seam so optional scale tensors and other architecture-dependent auxiliaries work without a synthetic tensor manifest.

### 4.2 Safetensors architecture adapter

An architecture adapter owns only source naming and genuine architecture semantics:

```cpp
class llama_safetensors_arch_adapter {
public:
    virtual bool probe(const hf_config & config) const = 0;
    virtual void emit_model_metadata(metadata_sink & sink) const = 0;
    virtual source_binding bind(const canonical_tensor_request & request) const = 0;
    virtual void validate_model_contract() const = 0;
};
```

A `source_binding` identifies source tensors and a composable transform chain. It should not directly contain backend code.

Common Hugging Face naming templates should be reusable:

- embeddings and output head;
- input/post-attention norms;
- Q/K/V/O projections;
- dense gate/up/down MLP projections;
- common MoE router and expert tensors.

Architecture adapters override only exceptional names or layouts. Qwen3.5 retains ownership of its linear-attention projections, QKV/Z permutations, output-projection column permutation, offset-norm conversion, `A_log` transform, and MTP naming.

### 4.3 Quantization adapters

Move numerical-format handling out of the Qwen adapter. Each reusable quant adapter must define:

- how it recognizes a producer contract;
- required weight, scale, zero-point, and optional auxiliary tensors;
- legal source dtypes and shapes;
- destination ggml type and dimensions;
- whether the source bytes are already canonical;
- bounded materialization/repack steps;
- supported CPU/CUDA/HIP backends and fallback behavior;
- validation of all correctness-critical auxiliaries.

Initial adapters:

| Adapter | Source contract | Runtime representation |
|---|---|---|
| FP8 channel | E4M3 weight plus BF16 per-output-channel scale | `GGML_TYPE_F8_E4M3` plus canonical scale tensor |
| FP8 block | E4M3 weight plus BF16 128x128 inverse-scale grid | `GGML_TYPE_F8_E4M3` plus canonical block-scale tensor |
| NVFP4 | packed 4-bit values, FP8 group scales, global input/weight scales | `GGML_TYPE_NVFP4` plus canonical auxiliaries |

Future W8A8, AWQ, and GPTQ support should add adapters rather than branches to every architecture importer.

### 4.4 Transform pipeline

Represent materialization as ordered, typed transforms instead of one architecture-specific function containing all cases.

Candidate transform stages:

1. source tensor read or mapped span;
2. source dtype validation;
3. generic rank/shape normalization;
4. architecture row or column permutation;
5. architecture value transform, such as offset-norm `+1` or `-exp(A_log)`;
6. quant adapter repack or scale conversion;
7. destination upload.

Ordering must be explicit because a permutation of packed values may require a corresponding permutation of scales. A binding must either transform every coupled tensor consistently or be rejected.

Transforms should expose whether they can operate in chunks. Full-tensor staging remains acceptable initially, bounded to one destination tensor, but streaming transforms are a later optimization.

### 4.5 Metadata and tokenizer bridge

Keep metadata separate from tensor enumeration.

Provide reusable helpers for:

- standard Hugging Face scalar configuration fields;
- RoPE and MRoPE configuration;
- sampling defaults;
- tokenizer vocabulary, merges, added tokens, and special-token IDs;
- chat-template discovery;
- conversion into the metadata keys already consumed by each model class.

The first refactor may continue emitting an in-memory GGUF metadata context for compatibility. It should contain model/tokenizer metadata only; tensor descriptions should come from `llama_tensor_source`.

Bypassing the in-memory GGUF metadata layer entirely is not required for this project. Reusing the existing hparam parser is lower risk and does not create an on-disk conversion.

### 4.6 Importer registry

Replace the hard-coded Qwen constructor with an ordered internal registry:

1. parse enough `config.json` to identify the architecture;
2. ask registered architecture adapters to probe;
3. require exactly one match;
4. construct the generic safetensors source with that adapter and parsed quantization configuration;
5. invoke the ordinary model-loading path.

Ambiguous matches and unsupported architectures must report the detected `model_type`, `architectures`, and quantization method.

## 5. Implementation phases

Each phase should be independently reviewable and should preserve the runnable
Qwen3.6 path. The initial release targets are Qwen3.8-27B plus the large-MoE
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`qwen4exp`) and DeepSeek-V4-Flash architectures.

### Phase 0 — Freeze trustworthy baselines

- [x] Record exact revisions for the representative Qwen3.8-27B release set:
  official block-FP8, Unsloth NVFP4, AWQ INT4, GPTQ INT4, AutoRound W4A16,
  W8A16 INT8, SmoothQuant W8A8, and BitsAndBytes NF4.
- [x] Pin the official Qwen3.8-Flash-Next and DeepSeek-V4-Flash safetensors
  revisions. Inventory their complete tensor contracts, including Qwen PLE
  shards and DeepSeek's mixed FP4/FP8 expert representation, before describing
  either source format as supported.
- [x] Record PP, TG, peak VRAM, peak host memory, load time, and first-token
  correctness on the reference hardware used for each external-engine comparison.
- [x] Profile and reduce native-directory load latency. Record cold- and warm-cache
  load times against the equivalent GGUF and vLLM source, separating manifest/
  metadata work, source reads, validation/repack, host-to-device upload, and first
  graph construction. On the 2026-09-02 A100 gate, model-only warm loads of the
  same BF16 tensors took 30.9--31.2 seconds from the native directory versus
  12.4--13.0 seconds from an equivalent BF16 GGUF. No-allocation construction
  accounts for only about 0.4 seconds of that gap. Enabling the GGUF mmap
  prefetch policy for every safetensors shard did not help (33.9--34.5 seconds)
  and was removed. Instrumentation then attributed 17.13 seconds to CPU
  materialization of 10.37 GiB of Qwen recurrent-layout tensors, versus 4.65
  seconds for direct upload of the other 39.74 GiB. The mapped layout fast path
  now permutes directly into one bounded uninitialized staging allocation and
  uploads that result, eliminating the redundant source-sized vector. Warm
  model-only load fell to 16.4 seconds, closing roughly 80% of the original
  native/GGUF gap without a whole-model duplicate. The final uncontended ordered
  loads were 18.05, 16.58, and 16.76 seconds (16.67-second warm median), with
  52.64--52.66 GiB peak RSS. Both the mapped fast path and buffered `--no-mmap`
  path matched the independent BF16 anchor at exactly zero KLD and 100% same-top.
- [x] Preserve direct projection correctness tests for every supported shape.
- [x] Preserve same-process reference-vs-reference anchor tests; the anchor must be exactly zero.
- [ ] Disable or reject experimental backend paths that are known to produce incorrect output.
- [x] Save vLLM commands, versions, and corresponding baselines.

Gate: every representative Phase-0 source loads and produces coherent greedy
output, and the recorded performance is reproducible within the chosen
thermal/clock tolerance.

The matrix uses the same A100-SXM4-80GB host, F16 KV, batch/ubatch 2048,
single sequence, and exact BF16 reference artifact for every native-engine
comparison. External-engine rows must record their engine revision and cannot
be mixed into the native timing table unless those execution conditions match.

The experimental Humming NVFP4 executor was removed after failing the A6000
coherence gate. It is not a selectable execution path in this branch; the
retained Humming FP8 executor is a separate implementation.

Matrix receipts recorded on the A100-SXM4-80GB on 2026-09-02:

- Native BF16 passed the 16K exact self-anchor with zero KLD at every reported
  statistic and 100% same-top. Its five-run averages were 3582.46 PP512,
  4075.66 PP2048, and 29.15 TG128; the first PP512 sample was a cold outlier
  (3014.44 versus 3715--3733 thereafter). Peak model-process RSS was 52.83 GiB
  and peak GPU residency was 50.71 GiB.
- SmoothQuant W8A8 passed coherent greedy generation and the full 16K panel:
  median KLD 0.004269, mean KLD 0.010246, p99 0.104072, and 95.545% same-top.
  Its five-run averages were 5305.95 PP512, 6205.32 PP2048, and 46.86 TG128;
  the first PP512 sample was again cold (3840.53 versus 5658--5683). Peak
  model-process RSS was 29.96 GiB and peak GPU residency was 28.07 GiB. The
  retained vLLM 0.28.0 comparison reached about 7795.86 PP2048 and 44.23 TG128
  on the same checkpoint and GPU, leaving a material prompt-processing gap but
  no decode deficit.
- Official block FP8 passed the full 16K panel with median KLD 0.001218, mean
  KLD 0.003070, p99 0.031344, and 97.604% same-top. Its five-run averages were
  3140.15 PP512, 3418.38 PP2048, and 42.52 TG128; peak model-process RSS was
  29.42 GiB and peak GPU use was 30.67 GiB. The intended block-scaled residual/
  RMS path remained enabled. Prompt processing trails both native BF16 and
  SmoothQuant W8A8 and is therefore a measured post-matrix optimization target.
  On the exact checkpoint, vLLM 0.28.0 reached median 3298.01 PP2048 and 49.23
  TG128: native execution is 3.65% faster for PP2048 but 13.64% slower for
  TG128. vLLM reported 5.56 seconds for shard loading and about 15 seconds from
  process start through engine initialization, versus roughly 152 seconds to
  native evaluation after a warm load.
- Unsloth NVFP4 passed the full 16K panel after separating topology-safe block-
  FP8 storage repacking from canonical channel-FP8 fallback execution: median
  KLD 0.008546, mean KLD 0.017724, p99 0.153687, p99.9 0.510997, and 94.001%
  same-top. On Ampere, where NVFP4 executes through software/Q8_1 rather than
  native FP4 tensor cores, its five-run averages were 1094.10 PP512, 1256.67
  PP2048, and 28.47 TG128. Peak model-process RSS was 22.44 GiB and peak GPU
  use was 20.94 GiB. These are support baselines, not a claim that Ampere is
  the preferred NVFP4 deployment target.
- Compressed-tensors AWQ INT4 passed coherent greedy generation and the full
  16K panel after Q4_A32 was excluded from shared BF16-retaining graph fusions
  whose epilogues had not proved asymmetric group-32 decoding end to end.
  Before that exclusion, the same imported weights were clean on CPU and with
  CUDA fusion disabled but produced median KLD 0.138924 and incoherent decode
  on the normal CUDA path. The repaired path reached median KLD 0.009504,
  mean KLD 0.022924, p99 0.242685, p99.9 0.745260, and 93.670% same-top. Its
  isolated native measurements were 2897.69 PP512, 3024.52 PP2048, and 57.19
  TG128; peak model-process RSS was 20.62 GiB and peak GPU use was 18.62 GiB.
  On the same checkpoint and A100, vLLM 0.28.0 selected its compressed-tensors
  Marlin kernel and reached median 3406.62 PP512, 3472.22 PP2048, and 70.96
  TG128 while reporting 18.37 GiB for model loading. Native is therefore about
  16.6% behind at PP2048 and 19.4% behind at TG128, with comparable resident
  weight memory. Exact residual-chain and GLU-chain CUDA regression tests now
  pin the repaired Q4_A32 graph boundary.
- Non-act-order GPTQ INT4 group-32 initially rejected the real Qwen3.8
  checkpoint because its recurrent projections require Qwen value-head row and
  column permutations. The importer now repacks to canonical Q4_1 first, then
  moves complete rows or block-aligned 32-value blocks together with their
  scale/minimum; a focused group-32 fixture pins codes, affine parameters, and
  head order. The repaired model generated coherently and passed the full 16K
  panel with median KLD 0.011511, mean KLD 0.028099, p99 0.285001, p99.9
  1.041912, and 92.898% same-top. Native measurements were 1494.17 PP512,
  1578.12 PP2048, and 65.49 TG128; peak model-process RSS was 20.72 GiB and
  peak GPU use was 19.57 GiB. vLLM 0.28.0 selected AutoGPTQ Marlin, reported
  17.88 GiB for model loading, and reached median 3538.55 PP512, 3637.57
  PP2048, and 72.41 TG128. The large prompt-processing gap and roughly 1.7 GiB
  resident-memory gap are the measured cost of the correctness-first 5-bpw
  Q4_1 representation and remain the principal compact-W4A16 optimization
  target after the format/architecture matrix is complete.
- Compressed-tensors AutoRound W4A16 group-128 initially rejected its signed
  FP16 group scales because the adapter had only admitted positive BF16 scales.
  The packed INT4 materializer now accepts F16/BF16, preserves finite non-zero
  sign, and converts the value to Q4_A32's BF16 scale field; a focused signed-
  scale fixture pins the contract. The real checkpoint generated coherently and
  passed the full 16K panel with median KLD 0.012353, mean KLD 0.028677, p99
  0.271468, p99.9 0.895385, and 92.868% same-top. Native measurements were
  2905.13 PP512, 3026.36 PP2048, and 58.32 TG128; peak process RSS was 19.25
  GiB and peak GPU use was 18.60 GiB. vLLM 0.28.0 selected compressed-tensors
  Marlin, reported 16.84 GiB model load memory, and reached median 3700.55
  PP512, 3628.31 PP2048, and 75.09 TG128. Native is about 16.6% behind at
  PP2048 and 22.3% behind at TG128; the compact-runtime and resident-memory
  gaps remain post-matrix optimization work.
- Compressed-tensors W8A16 group-128 with BF16 scales loaded without a format
  repair, generated coherently, and passed the full 16K panel with median KLD
  0.000315, mean KLD 0.000948, p99 0.008468, p99.9 0.042950, and 98.695%
  same-top. Native measurements were 1356.81 PP512, 1460.07 PP2048, and 26.67
  TG128; peak process RSS was 30.50 GiB and peak GPU use was 28.43 GiB. vLLM
  0.28.0 selected compressed-tensors Marlin, reported 28.03 GiB model load
  memory, and reached median 3281.26 PP512, 3131.73 PP2048, and 48.77 TG128.
  Resident weight memory was already close. The first packed-INT8 pass then
  added an in-place Q8-G128 Marlin layout (no second resident weight copy),
  aligned generic Q8-G128 loads, and an exact gate/up/SwiGLU fusion. The initial
  fusion was incoherent because the generic canonical-Q8 matcher interpreted
  the backend-private Marlin layout as ordinary Q8; a dedicated private-layout
  matcher now admits only the closed two-matmul/SwiGLU graph. Profiling also
  showed that one logical 34,816-row Marlin launch is faster only for decode-
  sized batches, while two 17,408-row launches are faster for prefill. The
  retained policy therefore uses the wide launch at `m <= 8` and the original
  two-launch fused epilogue above that. On the A100 this moved the checkpoint
  from 1356.81 PP512 / 1460.07 PP2048 / 26.67 TG128 to approximately 2684 /
  2749 / 43.68 in the final hybrid arm. The remaining gap to vLLM is about 12%
  at PP2048 and 10% at TG128; full Q/K/V and recurrent QKV/Z projection packing
  account for the remaining launch-count difference but require unequal-output
  segmented kernels rather than a blind extension of the equal-width pair.
  The pre-commit review then closed three defects shared by both Marlin
  executors: the launchers split batches with one policy (`marlin-common.cuh`)
  that only ever presents whole 64-row multiples or a final `<= 64`-row tail,
  because the vendor kernel silently drops any other remainder; launchers take
  the opt-in shared-memory limit from the backend's per-device table instead of
  querying the fork's logical device index, which is invalid under virtual
  devices; and the private Marlin layout is confined to the executors by a
  pre-capture pass (`ggml_cuda_canonicalize_unserved_marlin_weights`) that
  restores the canonical layout of any repacked weight reached through a
  contract the executors decline (a view, a broadcast batch, a non-contiguous
  activation, a copy), with an abort tripwire behind it. The paired launch
  passes its second weight/scale pair through explicit kernel parameters rather
  than reusing unrelated vendor arguments.
  The fidelity gate was rerun on a fresh A100 against a regenerated exact
  BF16 anchor (self-KLD exactly zero): the Marlin executor measures median KLD
  0.000171 with the fusion on or off and at `-ub 8` (the paired decode-width
  launch) or `-ub 512`, versus 0.000315 for the canonical MMQ path, so the
  BF16-activation Marlin path is also the more faithful one. Final-binary
  throughput on that box was 2706 / 2819 / 43.53 (PP512 / PP2048 / TG128) with
  the fusion, 2629 / 2737 / 42.25 without it, and 1456 / 1564 / 39.47 with
  Marlin disabled. A follow-up let the Q8 gate/up fusion retain its SwiGLU
  result as BF16 for the Q8 down projection (the retention predicate now admits
  any Marlin consumer at any served width, not only the 17,408-wide FFN), which
  removes one activation conversion per layer: 2756 / 2873 / 43.75 versus
  2675 / 2814 / 43.45 with retention disabled, KLD unchanged at 0.000171.
  Routing the Q8 fusion through the shared gate/up/GLU matcher also exposed
  that a repacked weight must stay out of every other small-batch matcher
  (the post-SiLU MMVQ fusion read the private layout at `m = 1` and produced
  NaN logits); `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` now admits a repacked Q8 weight only to
  that one matcher, and the MMVQ fusion predicate declines repacked weights.
  Profiling the W4A16 prefill then showed that the Marlin kernel is 88% of a
  prompt pass and runs at about half the tensor-core rate of the dense BF16
  GEMM on the same model (BF16 prefills at 3377 / 3999 PP512 / PP2048 versus
  2742 / 2951 for AWQ). Both Marlin executors therefore gained a large-batch
  route: above `GGML_CUDA_MARLIN_GEMM_MIN_M` (default 1024) the weight is
  dequantized straight from its private layout into a BF16 copy, one matrix at
  a time, and multiplied with cuBLAS; unfused projections take the F32 result
  directly, fused ones reuse the BF16 epilogues. With the route forced on the
  A100 the AWQ checkpoint reaches 2475 / 3012 / 3526 at micro-batch 512 / 1024
  / 2048 (Marlin: 2779 / 2901 / 2939; vLLM 3472 at 2048) and W8A16 reaches
  2416 / 2986 / 3569 (Marlin: 2730 / 2790 / 2833; vLLM 3132), so the crossover
  sits near 1024 rows. KLD is unchanged on the route (AWQ 0.009541 versus
  0.009504, W8A16 0.000159 versus 0.000171). The dequant (about 860 GB/s) and
  the activation conversions around each projection are the remaining prefill
  overhead. The same measurement generalized to the canonical quant types: on
  the A100 the MMQ kernels reach 74--79 TFLOPS at 4096 x 512 x 14336 against
  187 for a dense BF16 GEMM, so `ggml_cuda_mul_mat` now sends batches above
  `GGML_CUDA_MMQ_MAX_BATCH` rows (default 128; crossover measured near 192)
  through dequantize-plus-cuBLAS with BF16 inputs and F32 accumulation. The
  GPTQ checkpoint, which executes as Q4_1, moved from 1483 / 1564 to 2239 /
  3340 at micro-batch 512 / 2048 with KLD improving from 0.011511 to
  0.010214, because the activations stay in BF16 rather than Q8_1. This
  applies to every GGUF quantization on tensor-core hardware and is covered
  by the release regression pass rather than by this project's gates.
  A decode profile (CUDA graph nodes traced) then split the AWQ token time of
  17.2 ms into the Marlin kernel (11.9 ms, about 73% of memory bandwidth),
  the BF16 output head (1.7 ms), and roughly 1,400 small launches (3.6 ms):
  400 BF16-to-F32 output conversions, norms, residual adds, and the recurrent
  chain. The vendored Marlin kernel therefore gained an F32 output variant
  used by every unfused projection, which removed the 400 conversions per
  token: AWQ 59.5 TG128 (from 58.1), W8A16 44.3 (from 43.9). Two dormant
  fusions were then switched on: the projection + residual + RMS-norm chain
  matchers had been gated on block-FP8 weights, so their Marlin call never
  ran, and a blanket try_fuse early return had kept every Q4-A32 projection
  out of every fusion. With both active (and the chain always materializing
  its F32 norm output, which the cached-BF16 predicate had wrongly skipped for
  Q4 consumers), the A100 measures AWQ 2983 / 3694 / 60.7 and W8A16 2706 /
  3618 / 44.8 (PP512 / PP2048 / TG128) at unchanged KLD. A vLLM decode
  profile on the same GPU then attributed the remaining gap (71.0 and 48.8):
  the same Marlin kernel moving the same bytes takes 10.2 ms there in 255
  launches versus 11.9 ms here in 400, because vLLM packs Q/K/V and the
  recurrent qkv/gate projections into single launches. Per-launch timings
  show every launch of 20--40 us reaching only about 1.3 TB/s of the 2.0 TB/s
  peak, whatever its shape; a memory-streaming dp4a kernel over the Marlin
  layout (built, verified, then removed) reached exactly the same rate while
  costing W8A16 fidelity through Q8_1 activations. Launch width, not kernel
  quality, is what remains: a segmented launch for sibling projections that
  share an input is the next decode step.
- BitsAndBytes NF4 now loads the real Unsloth checkpoint and generates coherent
  greedy output. Qwen recurrent packed weights are permuted into canonical head
  order while a 28-byte scale-layout descriptor maps each destination block back
  to its original nested-scale block; this preserves exact nested quantization
  without expanding the model's scale arrays. A fixture whose head permutation
  crosses second-level 256-block groups and a CUDA mapped-scale operation test
  pin that contract. The full 16K panel reached median KLD 0.014419, mean KLD
  0.030736, p99 0.289774, p99.9 0.928127, and 92.433% same-top. The correctness-
  first scalar executor reached 6.25 PP512, 6.26 PP2048, and 4.54 TG128, with
  23.05 GiB peak process RSS. These numbers identify the executor itself as a
  post-matrix optimization project, not a production-speed baseline. vLLM
  0.28.0 cannot provide a comparison row because it rejects this checkpoint's
  `bitsandbytes` quantization method before allocation.
- Warm startup was initially dominated by parsing `tokenizer.json` through
  `nlohmann::ordered_json`. Its vector-backed object preserved order needed by
  quantization rule declarations but made Qwen's 248K-entry vocabulary
effectively quadratic. Tokenizer objects now use ordinary map-backed JSON;
token IDs remain authoritative and merge-array order remains intact. On the
warm A100 BF16 gate, tokenizer parsing fell from 47.68 to 0.28 seconds,
auto-fit fell from 53.14 to 1.10 seconds, and fit-enabled process startup fell
from 136.34 to 33.14 seconds. The remaining model-stage gap was subsequently
attributed to recurrent-layout materialization and reduced by the bounded
mapped-layout fast path described in the Phase-0 load-latency gate above.

An equivalent 866-tensor BF16 GGUF control now isolates metadata/model
construction from allocation and upload.  Three warm A100 `no_alloc` probes
averaged 1.61 seconds and 462 MiB peak RSS for the native directory versus
1.20 seconds and 403 MiB for GGUF.  Native source construction therefore costs
about 0.4 seconds, not the remaining 26.5 seconds.  The next load experiment is
the final uncontended mapped-versus-buffered exact-logit gate and an ordered
warm timing pair. Cold-cache figures remain storage-specific and must be
reported separately rather than mixed into the warm model-stage comparison.

### Phase 1 — Introduce `llama_tensor_source` without changing behavior

- [x] Define the internal source interface and ownership/lifetime rules.
- [x] Adapt the direct safetensors loader to implement it while preserving the public callback API.
- [x] Route `describe`, `get_tensor_info`, loading, progress accounting, and errors through one interface.
- [x] Keep synthetic tensor metadata temporarily as the source of descriptions.
- [x] Add tests for callback failure propagation, cancellation, optional tensors, and source lifetime.

The live source test now cancels two native-directory loads in one process
after eight progress callbacks each and requires a null model result both
times.  A separate successful CPU-only load then proves the same build remains
usable.  The Qwen3 W4A16 fixture cancelled at progress 0.556168 with 704 MiB
peak RSS; the follow-up load and generation completed with 1.17 GiB peak RSS.
The focused registry suite retains the required/optional binding and completion
checks.  Together these pin synchronous source lifetime and cleanup after a
partially populated model allocation rather than testing cancellation only
before source reads.

Gate: no tensor bytes, graph nodes, logits, PP, or TG change from the Phase-0 safetensors baseline; GGUF tests remain unchanged.

### Phase 2 — Make existing model tensor requests authoritative

- [x] Teach virtual `create_tensor()` to query `llama_tensor_source::describe()` directly.
- [x] Remove the requirement that virtual tensor descriptions live in GGUF tensor metadata.
- [x] Route `get_tensor_info()` through the same source.
- [x] Track successfully bound and loaded canonical tensors. Optional description probes do not count as bindings.
- [x] Extend `validate_complete()` from bound/load parity to required auxiliaries
  of every bound quantized weight. Dormant optional submodels may remain unbound.
- [x] Delete `qwen35_target_names()` after full-model parity smokes.

Gate: a recorded canonical manifest from `load_arch_tensors()` matches the former synthetic manifest exactly for both NVFP4 and block-FP8 models.

### Phase 3 — Extract generic quant adapters

- [x] Define the complete quant source-binding representation.
- [x] Move FP8-channel contract validation and scale binding out of the Qwen file.
- [x] Move FP8-block 128x128 validation, inverse-scale handling, and scale transpose out of the Qwen file.
- [x] Move NVFP4 packed-weight validation, repack, and scale binding out of the Qwen file.
- [x] Centralize dtype size and dtype-to-ggml-type mapping where it is truly format-generic.
- [x] Add isolated fixtures for missing scales, wrong scale dtype, wrong grid
  shape, zero points, invalid global scalars, dependency consumption, and
  overlapping compressed-tensors rules.

Gate: quant-adapter unit tests cover each accepted and rejected contract; Qwen output and performance remain at baseline.

### Phase 4 — Extract reusable metadata and tokenizer helpers

- [x] Split generic JSON/file helpers from the Qwen adapter.
- [x] Add a metadata sink with strict required/optional field handling.
- [x] Extract tokenizer vocabulary, merges, added-token, special-token, and chat-template conversion.
- [x] Extract common RoPE and sampling-default helpers without weakening architecture validation.
- [x] Keep architecture-specific GGUF key selection in the architecture adapter.

Gate: tokenizer round-trip tests match canonical token IDs and encode/decode results; chat-template output matches the GGUF reference.

### Phase 5 — Reduce Qwen3.5 to architecture-specific policy

- [x] Replace imperative ordinary projection mapping with shared naming templates.
- [x] Keep only recurrent projection names, MTP names, and genuine Qwen exceptions locally.
- [x] Express row/column permutations as explicit transform objects.
- [x] Express offset-norm and `A_log` conversions as explicit transform objects.
- [x] Replace the fixed 27B check with validated geometry where the existing Qwen model implementation supports it.
- [x] Report block-FP8 and NVFP4 source formats distinctly.

The Qwen adapter now accepts the dense model implementation's 24-, 32-, and
64-layer families, derives the recurrent K/V head grouping and dimensions from
`text_config`, and maps MTP after the configured trunk rather than after a
hard-coded layer 64. It rejects multiple MTP blocks, non-integral V/K head
groups, unequal recurrent K/V dimensions (the current graph uses one SSM state
dimension for both), and block-FP8 head layouts that cannot be expressed as an
exact 128-row scale grid. Channel scales and block-grid scales carry distinct
transform plans; in particular, an output channel scale is not permuted with
the input columns of its weight.

Gate: the Qwen adapter contains no quant-format implementation and no complete target manifest.

### Phase 6 — Prove the seam with a second existing architecture

- [x] Select a dense architecture already well supported through GGUF and available in one supported safetensors quant format.
- [x] Add only its configuration/name/layout adapter.
- [x] Do not add a model graph or duplicate backend kernel for the sake of safetensors.
- [x] Document which portions were reused unchanged.

Preferred proof target: a conventional dense Llama- or Qwen3-family model. A second irregular hybrid architecture should wait until the common path is proven.

Gate: the second architecture loads through its existing `llama_model_*` class, matches a clean GGUF/reference KLD panel within the declared near-zero tolerance, and exercises the same backend kernels for equivalent runtime tensor types.

Proof target: `RedHatAI/Qwen3-4B-FP8-dynamic`, a conventional 36-layer
Qwen3 model with channel-scaled E4M3 projections. The adapter adds Qwen3
configuration metadata and root names only. It reuses the ordinary decoder
name mapper, tokenizer/metadata bridge, compressed-tensors parser, generic
tensor materializer, existing `llama_model_qwen3` graph, and existing
F8-E4M3/BF16-scale backend path unchanged. No Qwen3 safetensors graph or
backend kernel was added.

The proof also generalized two producer/container seams discovered by the
second model: older compressed-tensors checkpoints may declare the
single-format `float-quantized` schema and select projections by the `Linear`
module class, and pure channel-FP8 GGUF export must preserve F8 tensors just as
the mixed NVFP4+FP8 exporter already did.

Gate results on one RTX A6000:

- 651/651 canonical tensors matched the GGUF control byte-for-byte
  (5,192,136,704 bytes).
- Both paths exposed 145 F32, 254 BF16, and 252 F8-E4M3 tensors.
- All 16,384 live WikiText logit rows matched bit-for-bit across the full
  151,936-token vocabulary. The resulting KLD is exactly zero.
- The native directory loaded through `llama_model_qwen3` and generated a
  coherent greedy continuation.

The live-logit gate is intentional. `llama-perplexity`'s `.kld` artifact
quantizes saved log probabilities to `uint16_t`, so comparing a model to its
own saved artifact is not an exact-zero anchor. Native and GGUF produced
byte-identical per-position values even through that lossy instrument, but the
live comparison is the proof of exact equality.

### Phase 7 — Loading and memory optimization

- [x] Replace avoidable source-vector copies with read-only shard mappings.
- [x] Read row- and block-local transforms from mappings into one final target buffer.
- [x] Upload identical source layouts directly into the final selected backend buffer.
- [x] Preserve one-final-tensor-at-a-time peak-memory bounds for transformed tensors.
- [x] Investigate zero-copy CPU mappings for identical canonical layouts.
- [x] Measure load time, peak host RAM, steady-state model bytes, and storage reads.

Gate: no complete model duplication, no temporary GGUF, and no throughput regression after load.

The registry now keeps each shard mapped for the importer lifetime. Plain BF16,
F32, and raw F8 tensors use the mapped address in one synchronous full-tensor
backend upload. NVFP4, W8A8, AWQ, and GPTQ transforms read the mapped source
directly and allocate only their final canonical tensor image. A full backend
set is intentional: CPU repack and optional CUDA-private upload transforms
require offset zero and the complete tensor. True mapped CPU tensor ownership
would require a source-aware buffer allocator and lifetime handoff before the
current destination-allocation seam; it was investigated and deferred rather
than emulated with an unsafe view. `--no-mmap` is honored: the same registry
falls back to checked, bounded file reads and never exposes a mapped address.
The registry also preserves `--direct-io` through `llama_file`'s aligned direct
read path (including its existing platform fallback), while `--mlock` and
`mmap+mlock` lock final CPU-resident model buffers rather than the temporary
source mapping.

Measured on one RTX A6000, including model load and a three-repeat PP512/TG128
run:

| source (pinned revision) | canonical model bytes | peak host RSS | wall time | PP512 | TG128 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `nytopop/Qwen3-4B.w8a8@57645321` | 5,417,007,104 | 6,080 MiB | 36.21 s | 8,017 t/s | 121.5 t/s |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-AWQ@74d4bd2b` | 3,049,519,104 | 3,690 MiB | 34.87 s | 7,864 t/s | 169.7 t/s |
| `JunHowie/Qwen3-4B-GPTQ-Int4@8153b802` | 3,049,519,104 | 3,693 MiB | 34.05 s | 7,837 t/s | 169.4 t/s |

The measurement command was `llama-bench -m <directory> -ngl 99 -fa on
-p 512 -n 128 -r 3 -o json`, wrapped by `/usr/bin/time -v` for wall time and
peak RSS.

Warm-cache storage reads were zero for the retained W8A8 and GPTQ runs (the
first W8A8 run reported 496 filesystem input blocks). These are not cold-disk
numbers. A parallel row-repack experiment did not change W8A8 wall time and was
removed; the recurring startup cost is dominated downstream of the source-copy
loop. Steady-state graphs contain only canonical ggml tensors and no source
format dispatch.

### Phase 8 — Add further quant formats independently

- [x] Add W8A8 compressed-tensors support.
- [x] Add AWQ support with an explicit decision between native execution and load-time repack.
- [x] Add non-act-order GPTQ support.
- [x] Treat act-order GPTQ as a separate runtime-kernel project unless an exact canonical representation is designed.
- [x] Record CPU, CUDA, HIP, split/offload, and mmap capabilities for each adapter.

Gate: each new format has contract fixtures, projection correctness, end-to-end KLD, backend capability checks, and independent PP/TG measurements.

The first W8A8 adapter accepts only the measured compressed-tensors contract:
signed INT8 channel weights, BF16 channel scales, and dynamic symmetric INT8
token activations. It preserves every INT8 code and folds each BF16 channel
scale into existing Q8_0 blocks. Against an exactly dequantized BF16 control on
the canonical 16K WikiText panel it measured median KLD 0.000106, mean 0.000564,
p99 0.006248, and 99.219% same-top.

AWQ and identity-map GPTQ currently unpack their producer-specific INT32 layout
and fold affine parameters into Q4_1. This preserves the 4-bit codes and works
through existing placement and backend machinery, but costs 5.0 bpw and uses
W4A8 arithmetic. The authoritative AWQ packing permutation is
`[0,4,1,5,2,6,3,7]`; GPTQ uses ordinary nibble order and its v1 stored-zero
`+1` convention.

Act-order GPTQ is a distinct native representation: it keeps packed I4 weights,
unpacked group zero codes, original F16/BF16 scales, and a compact per-column
`g_idx`. CPU and CUDA reference executors index the arbitrary group map during
the dot product. On the real
`chieunq/Qwen3-1.7B-gptq-v2-4bit-gsm8k2048` checkpoint, the prompt `The capital
of France is` matched GPTQModel's argmax and all top-10 tokens with last-logit
KLD 0.000679. The scrambled group map is therefore exercised end to end rather
than inferred from a synthetic identity fixture.

Qwen3.5 recurrent projections add row/column layout transforms. Non-act-order
AWQ/GPTQ is first repacked into canonical Q4_1 blocks; row transforms then move
complete rows, while column transforms move only block-aligned 32-value blocks
with their scale and minimum. W8A8/NVFP4 likewise use block-aware column
permutations. GPTQ act-order remains rejected for these recurrent projections:
its separate `g_idx`, scale, and zero bundle requires a coupled transform that
has not yet been designed and proved.

One 512-token WikiText control per format measured the representation cost
against weights dequantized directly from the same source tensors:

| source | median KLD | mean KLD | p99 KLD | same-top |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| AWQ W4A16-g128 -> Q4_1 | 0.000684 | 0.003999 | 0.041151 | 97.647% |
| GPTQ W4A16-g128 -> Q4_1 | 0.001656 | 0.014044 | 0.218618 | 97.647% |

Those results are not near-zero and must not be described as transparent native
AWQ/GPTQ execution. Production parity still requires a group-128 W4A16 type
and executor (or an integrated maintained executor such as Marlin). The value
of these adapters is a strict loader/reference path and a reusable correctness
oracle for that kernel work.

| adapter output | CPU | CUDA | HIP | layer/tensor placement and CPU offload | direct source mmap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| raw BF16/F32 and channel-scaled F8 | canonical backend support | canonical backend support | canonical backend support | yes | yes |
| NVFP4 | existing NVFP4 type | existing NVFP4 type | existing NVFP4 type | yes | no (repack) |
| W8A8 -> Q8_0 | existing Q8_0 type | existing Q8_0 type | existing Q8_0 type | yes | no (repack) |
| AWQ/identity-GPTQ -> Q4_1 | existing Q4_1 type | existing Q4_1 type | existing Q4_1 type | yes | no (repack) |
| GPTQ act-order | scalar reference | scalar reference | explicit reject | CPU/CUDA placement | yes |
| BitsAndBytes NF4/FP4 | scalar reference | scalar reference | explicit reject | CPU/CUDA placement | yes |
| BitsAndBytes INT8 | channel-INT8 fallback | channel-INT8 executor | explicit reject | CPU/CUDA placement | yes |

The A6000 gates include CUDA execution for all three new adapters and an
all-CPU GPTQ smoke test (2.0 PP t/s, 1.5 TG t/s). A raw channel-FP8 model also
completed a CUDA `load_mode=none` smoke (PP16 248.3 t/s, TG8 111.9 t/s), proving
that disabling mmap takes the bounded-read/materialization path rather than the
direct mapped upload. HIP and multi-device split inherit established
Q8_0/Q4_1 kernels and placement semantics, but still need real-machine
regression runs before release.

The release-matrix CPU gate now also covers the representations that no longer
repack into those established types.  A native Qwen3-4B dynamic channel-INT8
checkpoint loaded entirely on CPU and generated `Paris. The capital of Germany
is Berlin` (9.81 GiB peak RSS).  A native Qwen3-1.7B BitsAndBytes-NF4
checkpoint completed the same CPU-only load/decode path in 59.9 seconds with
2.67 GiB peak RSS and a coherent Paris continuation.  These are portability
proofs for the reference executors, not performance claims.

A real Qwen3-1.7B MXFP8 checkpoint also completed CPU-only loading and generated
`Paris. The capital of Italy is Rome` with 5.13 GiB peak RSS. Load took 90.8
seconds and prompt/decode each ran at about 0.02 tokens/second, so this closes
the CPU correctness/placement proof only; the scalar CPU executor is not a
production performance path.

### Rejected experiment — packed sibling projections

The A6000 comparison exposed a graph-topology difference rather than a weak
integer kernel. In one PP512 pass, native Q4 Marlin plus Q8 MMQ consumed about
231.5 ms, while vLLM's Marlin families consumed about 239.6 ms. vLLM packs
attention Q/K/V, dense gate/up, recurrent QKV/Z, and recurrent beta/alpha.

A complete dense gate/up proof concatenated the two canonical Q4-A32 tensors
without increasing steady model bytes, built one matmul followed by typed
half-row views, and added a dedicated Marlin BF16 split-SwiGLU epilogue. This
closed the accidental generic-fallback regression, but the resulting
34,816-row Marlin launch was slower than the established pair of 17,408-row
launches on Ampere:

| A6000, PP512/TG128, same binary | PP512 t/s | TG128 t/s |
|---|---:|---:|
| separate gate/up | 1696.7–1702.9 | 32.71–32.79 |
| packed gate/up + fused split-SwiGLU | 1613.3–1626.8 | 32.25–32.77 |

Packing therefore lost about 4.7% prefill with no decode benefit. The code was
removed. This Q4 result does not contradict the later Q8-G128 fusion: the Q8
implementation keeps the established narrow launches for prefill and uses a
purpose-built paired projection only for `m <= 8`, where it measured about 3%
faster decode. Do not generalize vLLM's packed-module topology onto every
quantized executor; each wider projection needs its own batch-size crossover
and kernel proof.

### Retained Ampere recurrent-path fusions

Two exact Qwen3.8 recurrent-prefill fusions were retained for the native
group-affine path on an RTX A6000:

- paired Q/K L2 normalization now runs in the FLA BF16 input packer, preserving
  llama.cpp's reduction order and `rsqrtf(fmaxf(sum, eps*eps))` contract while
  avoiding the intermediate F32 tensors; and
- a Q4-A32 recurrent projection can leave its already-rounded BF16 output in
  the graph destination for the split convolution to consume directly, rather
  than widening it to F32 only for the convolution to read it back as BF16.

The first changes the measured kernels from 1.309 ms of L2 normalization plus
2.242 ms of ordinary packing to 2.383 ms of combined normalization and packing
per PP512 pass. The second removes 48 BF16-to-F32 output conversions and changes
the 48 recurrent convolution launches from 3.632 ms in F32 to 2.299 ms in BF16.
Together, the final five-sample A6000 measurements were 1704.16 PP2048 t/s and
32.66 TG128 t/s. The control, L2-fused, and convolution-deferred 121 MiB logits
files were byte-identical, with SHA-256
`8a2ea9c88341c96c593821f2c9c920844f95e5eb48c8d7aaead5e20ccc181833`.

The residual/RMS epilogue now also omits its F32 normalized output when every
consumer is a supported Q4-A32 Marlin projection and can therefore reuse the
epilogue's persistent BF16 activation. Two order-balanced PP2048 pairs measured
1708.99 versus 1705.75 t/s and 1704.56 versus 1700.54 t/s, a combined gain of
about 0.22%. TG128 remained flat at 32.64 t/s. The resulting logits file was
again byte-identical to the same SHA-256 baseline. The consumer scan is strict:
an output tensor, a non-matmul use, or an unsupported projection preserves the
ordinary F32 materialization.

A GDN epilogue also folds the following RMS normalization, SiLU gate, and
multiply into the BF16 output unpack. The raw gate projection is made available
early only when each sequence contains more than one token, so decode retains
its original graph order. This removes 48 unary-gated launches per PP512 pass;
the fused unpack costs 2.28 ms instead of 1.57 ms, while removing about 2.78 ms
of unary work. Two order-balanced PP2048 pairs on the retained stack measured
1724.72 versus 1718.46 t/s (+0.36%). The earlier decode regression therefore
does not apply to this prefill-only form. Its 121 MiB logits file was
byte-identical to the same reference SHA-256.

Packing the recurrent Q/K/V and Z projections into the same 16,384-row Marlin
launch was also tested because vLLM represents those checkpoint tensors as one
merged projection. The combined Marlin kernel took essentially the same time
as the two original kernels, while splitting its output back into the existing
Q/K/V and Z graph tensors cost about 3 ms per PP512 pass. Steady PP2048 was
1701.06 t/s, a tie/slight loss against 1700.5--1705.8 t/s controls, and the
proof required about 1.9 GiB of duplicate packed weights. The implementation
was removed. A production packed loader would eliminate the duplicate weights,
but not the measured output-split cost, so it is not justified for the current
Ampere Marlin executor.

The two small recurrent beta/alpha BF16 projections share one F32 input. The
ordinary cuBLAS path converted that input independently for both projections.
Reusing the existing per-stream BF16 image for the second projection removes
54 conversion launches per PP512 pass while leaving both GEMMs unchanged. A
stable PP2048 A6000 pair measured 1718.94 versus 1702.50 t/s (+0.97%); TG128
was unchanged. The 121 MiB logits file was byte-identical to the baseline SHA
above. The retained matcher is deliberately narrow (`[48,5120]` BF16 weights,
F32 input, prefill only), because those two consumers do not mutate their
shared source between reads.

A generic version was also measured at 1720.53 versus 1697.40 PP2048 t/s, but
changed the logits file. Tensor identity alone is not a valid general cache
key: graph storage may be updated in place between consumers. The broad form
was rejected as a correctness bug rather than accepted as an additional small
performance gain.

Two smaller prefill launch fusions follow vLLM's fused Qwen GDN preparation
without changing either projection or the embedded FLA math. First, the two
ordinary beta/alpha cuBLAS projections now feed one pointwise epilogue for
add/softplus/multiply and sigmoid. Two order-balanced pairs measured a combined
1721.13 versus 1718.02 PP2048 t/s (+0.18%). Batch-one decode retains its older
specialized dot-and-gate kernel. Second, the existing Q/K/V L2+BF16 pack launch
also copies the already-computed gate, beta, and recurrent state into FLA head
order; its V grid already spans all of those elements. This removes the
separate head-pack launch and measured a combined 1716.28 versus 1713.26 t/s
(+0.18%) in two order-balanced pairs. Both changes are Ampere GDN-prefill-only;
their stacked 121 MiB logits file was byte-identical to the same reference SHA.
The retained stack measured a steady PP512 median of 1728.95 t/s, a PP2048
median of 1704.58 t/s (1706.03 mean), and a TG128 median of 32.75 t/s on the
A6000.

Two further exact handoff fusions did not earn retention. Copying the recurrent
state into graph order inside the following RMS epilogue removed 48 launches
and about 0.54 ms of profiled work, but two order-balanced PP2048 pairs were a
tie: their combined means differed by less than 0.2%, and the combined median
favored the original schedule. Deferring the recurrent Z/gate projection's
already-rounded BF16 output directly into the SiLU-and-multiply consumer also
removed 48 widening launches, but lost 0.28% in both combined mean and median
(1709.97 versus 1714.84 t/s mean). Both implementations were removed.

### Retained W8 MMQ activation reuse

The mixed INT4/INT8 Qwen3.8 checkpoint has 88 W8A8 projections per PP pass.
The ordinary MMQ entry quantized its F32 activation independently for every
projection, even when dense gate/up or attention Q/K/V consume the same graph
tensor. Two exact CUDA changes remove that duplicated work:

- adjacent same-shape Q8_0_G128 projections use the existing paired-MMQ
  executor, extended to ordinary dense matmuls, so gate/up share one Q8_1
  activation image; and
- a graph proof recognizes exactly three direct Q8 matmul consumers of one
  activation, rejects any other consumer or unsafe output-range overlap, and
  lets Q/K/V reuse one grow-only per-stream image. The largest observed image
  is about 2.8 MiB. Ambiguous graphs and non-CUDA backends fall back unchanged.

Together these reduce `quantize_mmq_q8_1` from 88 launches / 2.38 ms to 48
launches / 1.46 ms per PP512 pass. Order-balanced PP2048 gates measured
paired-MMQ at 1714.33 versus 1707.34 t/s (+0.41%), then Q/K/V reuse at 1713.92
versus 1707.59 t/s (+0.37%) with pairing enabled in both arms. Batch-one uses
MMVQ and declines both paths. The combined logits file remained byte-identical
to SHA-256 `8a2ea9c88341c96c593821f2c9c920844f95e5eb48c8d7aaead5e20ccc181833`.

## 6. Broad quantization coverage

Native loading is not considered support unless the source representation,
every correctness-critical auxiliary tensor, the graph operation, and the
selected backend agree on the same numerical contract. Metadata recognition
alone is not support. Unsupported combinations must fail before model buffers
are allocated rather than silently converting to a different quantizer.

The implementation order is deliberately shared-contract-first:

| Family | Source contract | Current state | Next proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| BF16/F16/F32 | plain tensors | direct upload | second-architecture and placement matrix |
| NVFP4 | packed E2M1, group-16 E4M3 scales, two global scales | native importer and CUDA executor | freeze KLD/perf baselines; HIP is an explicit reject |
| FP8 W8A8 dynamic | E4M3 weights, channel or 128x128 weight scales, dynamic token activations | native channel/block paths; compressed-tensors `naive-quantized`, bounded FBGEMM FP8, and Quark PTPC schemas recognized | retain exact backend capability gates and add HIP implementations |
| Grouped FP8 W8A8 | E4M3 weights and BF16 scales per 32 values, dynamic group-32 activations | native importer plus scalar CPU/CUDA reference execution | real-model KLD and optimized CUDA kernel |
| FP8 W8A8 static | E4M3 weights, tensor weight scale, tensor input scale | native CUDA scalar-scale path; real ModelOpt mixed checkpoint executes | freeze KLD against its framework reference; reject unsupported backends early |
| INT8 W8A8 dynamic | I8 weights, channel scale, dynamic token activations | native CUDA executor; compact/current compressed-tensors schemas and real SmoothQuant+GPTQ and Quark checkpoints execute | complete CPU/HIP/partial-placement policy |
| INT8 W8A8 static | I8 weights, tensor/channel weight scale, tensor input scale, optional activation zero point | symmetric and asymmetric CUDA paths; real asymmetric checkpoint executes | add a public full-model fixture and placement matrix |
| EETQ W8A16 | transposed I8 weights and one FP16 scale per output channel | exact load-time transpose into Q8_0; preserves every code and scale with 6.25% block-scale overhead | real-model logits proof and native weight-only CUDA fast path if demand justifies it |
| Quanto W8A16 | I8 or E4M3 weights and one BF16/F16 scale per output channel (`qint8`, `qfloat8_e4m3fn`) | native raw-code loading with a self-describing scale sidecar; CPU reference and CUDA execution; real qint8/qfloat8 full-model logits proven | add HIP execution and large-model performance gates |
| Quanto W4A16 | packed qint4 data plus per-group scale and shift | load-time Q4_1 repack and CPU/CUDA execution | replace the correctness-first repack with an exact native executor before claiming parity with Quanto |
| AWQ/GPTQ W4A16 | packed I4 plus group scale/zero | exact Q4_1 repack for AWQ and identity-map GPTQ at group sizes divisible by 32, including per-channel; F16/BF16 scales; AutoRound GPTQ sidecar configs and per-module precision exceptions | widen real-model coverage for g32/g64 and architecture transforms |
| W4A8 INT8 | group-128 I4 weights and dynamic/static INT8 activations | exact Q4-A32 repack plus scaled CUDA executor | full-model KLD/perf and unsupported-backend gates |
| W4A8 FP8 | group-128 I4 weights and dynamic FP8 activations | exact repack plus CUDA executor | Hopper/Blackwell real-model KLD/perf |
| MXFP4/MXFP8 | microscaled weights/activations and E8M0 sidecars | native compressed-tensors importer and CUDA execution; Quark MXFP4 schema and real checkpoint proven | real-model KLD/perf on each supported architecture |
| AutoRound/INC MXFP4/MXFP8 | the same group-32 MX values and E8M0 scales, declared by the compact AutoRound schema | maps onto the existing MXFP contracts, including exact per-module FP16 exceptions and the optional `quantization_config.json` sidecar; a real Qwen3-1.7B MXFP8 checkpoint completed CPU-only load and coherent generation | optimized CPU execution is out of scope; retain CUDA fidelity/performance and unsupported-backend gates |
| TorchAO tiled INT4 / unpacked INT8 | `Int4TilePackedTo4dTensor` and `IntxUnpackedToInt8Tensor` safetensors subclasses | exact load-time repack into Q4_1/Q8_0; all tiled lanes and INT8 rows covered | native execution formats if load time or repack precision becomes material |
| Transformers HQQ INT4 | flattened axis-1 `4bit_u8` codes with learned F16 scale/zero per group | exact code-preserving Q4_1 repack for unquantized metadata at group sizes divisible by 32; public Llama-3.2-1B checkpoint loads and generates coherently | external-reference KLD and a native metadata-preserving executor |
| ExecuTorch HQQ experts | packed signed INT4 expert rows plus one BF16 scale per 128 values | exact nibble-preserving Q4_0 repack for the public Qwen3.5-MoE export; every expert/row/lane covered | external-reference KLD and a native scale-preserving executor |
| WNA16 | packed 2--8-bit weights, group scales/zeros | exact 4-bit group-32 and 8-bit group-128 subsets cover the current mainstream releases | defer native 2/3/5/6-bit layouts until a real checkpoint and user demand justify them |
| BitsAndBytes | NF4/FP4 codes with block absmax and optional nested scale quantization; INT8 rows with SCB absmax | native packed 4-bit types and exact nested-scale bundle plus serialized INT8/SCB loading; real NF4 and INT8 models load and generate coherently | optimize 4-bit CUDA, add HIP, and add LLM.int8 outlier decomposition where its threshold materially changes fidelity |
| GPTQ act-order | packed I4 plus non-identity `g_idx` | native packed type and compact scale/zero/group bundle; real-model CPU/CUDA reference execution and external KLD proof | optimize CUDA and add HIP; transformed Qwen3.5 recurrent projections reject early |
| ModelOpt W4A4 NVFP4 | NVFP4 weights and NVFP4 activations | explicitly rejected; W4A16 and mixed W4A16/FP8 are supported | Blackwell activation-quantization executor and real-model fidelity/perf |

Producer names are not treated as numerical formats. Quark W4A16, static FP8,
PTPC FP8, INT8, NVFP4, and MXFP4 all map onto the same canonical contracts as
their compressed-tensors/ModelOpt counterparts. FBGEMM's
`activation_scale_ub` is preserved in the dynamic-FP8 marker and applied before
the row scale is chosen. SmoothQuant checkpoints need no special runtime
operator when smoothing has already been folded into the stored weights; their
remaining INT8 or FP8 tensor contract is handled normally.

That distinction is now backed by a public FP8 checkpoint rather than config
inspection alone. `MLliu6/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-SmoothQuant-W8A8-FP8` loaded
directly, selected the shared channel-FP8 path, and generated a coherent Paris
answer. The smoothing operation had already been folded by the producer; no
runtime smoothing tensor or extra graph multiply was present.

The Quanto `qint8` proof is at the independently dequantized BF16 control
floor: last-token KLD 0.00039238 against the official Quanto execution versus
0.00039069 for the BF16 control, with the same argmax. Quanto `qfloat8_e4m3fn`
measures 0.00020709 against official Quanto on the shared token sequence; the
plain BF16 engine/reference floor is 0.00016884. The qint4 Q4_1 repack improves
substantially over an ordinary Q4_1 interpretation (0.00045605 versus
0.00113866 KLD), but remains above its dequantized-BF16 control floor
(0.00012797), so it is usable coverage rather than exact format parity.

Still outside the release coverage are genuinely different numerical/layout
families rather than config aliases: ModelOpt W4A4 NVFP4 activation execution,
EXL2/EXL3, AQLM, SpQR, VPTQ, HIGGS, SINQ, HQQ 1/2/3/8-bit, axis-0,
float-view, or metadata-quantized variants, Quanto qint2, sparse TorchAO
layouts, and native 2/3/5/6-bit WNA16. They must not be advertised as
supported or silently requantized.

MLX is also intentionally outside this project phase. Although MLX checkpoints
use safetensors as a container, their tensor layouts target the separate MLX and
Metal execution ecosystem. This fork does not yet have Metal implementations of
its KV codec families, so MLX import would not provide a coherent supported
backend. Revisit it only as part of a broader Metal project.

### 6.1 Release scope informed by Qwen3.8-27B

A 2026-09-01 Hugging Face inventory found 933 repositories attached as
quantizations of `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`. Name/tag counts overlap, but their relative
prevalence is useful: 342 GGUF, 344 MLX, 110 NVFP4, 76 FP8, 56 GPTQ, 42 AWQ,
41 AutoRound, 24 EXL3, four BitsAndBytes, and one direct SmoothQuant base-model
release. No HQQ or Quanto release for this model surfaced in the same search.

The native-safetensors release boundary is therefore:

1. official block-FP8;
2. mixed NVFP4/FP8/BF16 checkpoints;
3. AWQ, GPTQ, and AutoRound W4A16;
4. W8A16 INT8;
5. SmoothQuant W8A8; and
6. BitsAndBytes NF4.

WNA16 is an execution umbrella, not a checkpoint format that is commonly named
as such. Qwen3.8 has ordinary W4A16 and W8A16 releases, which are in scope, but
only isolated INT5/INT6 AutoRound experiments and effectively no ordinary
W2A16/W3A16 publication ecosystem. Native 2/3/5/6-bit WNA16 is consequently a
demand-driven post-release project, not a release requirement.

EXL3 is a real but separate ecosystem. Its trellis/codebook representation needs
a new executor rather than another metadata alias, so its presence does not
expand the initial native-safetensors release boundary.

Generic ModelOpt W4A4 NVFP4 activation execution remains on the near-term
post-release roadmap. DeepSeek-V4-Flash is a separate release target whose
official configuration declares FP4 experts inside a block-FP8 model. Its exact
stored expert layout and activation contract must be inventoried from the shard
headers and execution reference. If that contract is not already represented
canonically, the narrowly required DeepSeek executor becomes a release blocker;
it must not be assumed to be identical to ModelOpt W4A4 from metadata alone.

The public `SocialLocalMobile/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-HQQ-INT4` checkpoint provides a
different, fully serialized path: tiled TorchAO INT4 dense projections,
TorchAO unpacked-INT8 embeddings, and scale-only HQQ routed experts under the
flat ExecuTorch Qwen3.5-MoE namespace. The native loader now maps that namespace,
reuses the existing runtime architecture, supports its fused full-attention QKV
projection, and generates coherently. This is not a claim of generic HQQ
support: it is separate from the now-supported Transformers `4bit_u8`/axis-1
contract, and other HQQ bit widths and metadata modes remain distinct.

The generic HQQ proof uses the public
`nm-testing/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-HQQ` checkpoint. Its 112 projections retain
the producer's code lanes and learned affine parameters during load-time Q4_1
repacking; with F16 KV (the model's 64-dimensional heads do not satisfy this
fork's default Turbo4 KV block contract), it generated `The capital of France
is Paris.` at 2075.4 prompt and 393.2 generation tokens/s on the A100 test box.
An all-CPU load and generation arm also passed, confirming that the portable
Q4_1 materialization is not CUDA-placement-only.

Architecture coverage is a separate axis. Qwen2, Qwen3, Qwen3.5, Qwen3-VL,
Llama, and classic Mistral currently exercise the generic importer seam. TinyLlama
with a serialized BitsAndBytes INT8 checkpoint provides the Llama-family proof:
154 quantized matrices were recognized, the full model loaded without a whole-
model conversion, and greedy generation returned a coherent Paris answer.
For Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, all 291 native tensors (14,496,579,584 bytes)
matched a fresh BF16 GGUF conversion exactly. Native safetensors and GGUF now
produce bit-identical CUDA logits; against the Transformers BF16 reference the
last-token KLD is 0.0000894 (the CPU GGUF control is 0.0000938). This proof also
caught and closed an unrelated CUDA integration bug: the Qwen-specific hidden-
BF16 GLU handoff had been admitted for Mistral's 14,336-wide FFN even though its
producer contract is the Qwen 17,408-wide path.

### 6.2 Initial large-MoE architecture boundary

The initial architecture boundary includes both current flagship large MoEs:

1. `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next`, whose source identifies as `qwen4_exp`; and
2. `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash`, whose source identifies as `deepseek_v4`.

Both ordinary runtime architectures already exist on current master. Qwen4 is
`LLM_ARCH_QWEN4EXP` with `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp`; it is not the older
`LLM_ARCH_QWEN3NEXT` path. DeepSeek uses `LLM_ARCH_DEEPSEEK4` and
`src/models/deepseek4.cpp`. Native safetensors adapters must therefore translate
source metadata, names, auxiliary quant tensors, and the few required layout
transforms into those existing model classes. They must not duplicate QSA,
PLE, hyper-connection, compressed-attention, MTP, VBR, or multimodal graph
logic inside the importer.

The existing Qwen4 converter is the mapping oracle. In particular, its PLE
hash constants remain exact integers, its 128 n-gram embedding shards remain
bounded/chunked rather than concatenated into a second whole-model allocation,
its combined indexer Q/K projection is split into the canonical runtime tensors,
and its Qwen3-VL vision tower continues through the established vision model.
The direct importer must express the same contracts through bounded source
bindings instead of producing an intermediate GGUF.

DeepSeek-V4 already requests routed expert weights as canonical 3-D
`ffn_{gate,down,up}_exps` tensors. That representation is also a runtime
offload contract: `--cpu-moe` and `--n-cpu-moe` place those tensors in host
memory, while the adaptive cache discovers host `WEIGHTS` buffers by canonical
`_exps`/`_chexps` names, three-dimensional shape, and backend-supported expert
stride. The safetensors path must preserve those allocation roots, names,
dimensions, buffer usage, and per-expert addressability. An opaque importer-
owned packed aggregate that happens to execute on one GPU is not acceptable.

Release proof for each large MoE requires:

- bounded direct load without a temporary GGUF or a second resident model;
- coherent generation and reference KLD for the exact source quant contract;
- layer split and tensor split across multiple GPUs;
- partial expert placement with `--cpu-moe` and `--n-cpu-moe`;
- `--moe-cache auto`, `on`, `soft`, explicit budget, and multi-GPU expert-
  parallel cache paths, including cold/warm correctness and stable residency;
- agreement between fit-time placement/accounting and the final loaded buffers;
- MTP, VBR, long-context, and teardown gates; and
- Qwen4 text and multimodal/PLE paths, including bounded loading of the large
  n-gram table.

Current architecture proof (2026-09-01):

- The source contracts are pinned at Qwen revision
  `de4b8e4d43b917e7706784d8bb445c9af86a3540` and DeepSeek revision
  `60d8d70770c6776ff598c94bb586a859a38244f1`.
- The official 149 GiB DeepSeek checkpoint loads directly with all 43 trunk
  layers assigned to CUDA, while its 129 trunk routed-expert roots stay in
  `CUDA_Host` under `-ot 'exps=CPU'`. The final buffers are 7418.32 MiB on CUDA
  and 141362.00 MiB in pinned host storage. Greedy chat generation completed
  coherently (`The capital of France is` -> `Paris.`) through the existing
  DeepSeek graph. This end-to-end proof caught a source-boundary bug in
  `load_arch_hparams()`: its MTP-presence probe used GGUF-only `get_weight()`,
  reset `n_layer_nextn` to zero for a valid direct source, and executed the MTP
  block as a 44th trunk layer. The source-aware `has_tensor()` probe now
  preserves `n_layer=43`, `n_layer_all=44`; the same reusable existence check
  replaces GGUF-only MTP/trunk probes in the other MTP-capable model classes.
  Disabling the optimized block-FP8
  executor did not repair the pre-fix output, which independently excluded that
  kernel as the cause. Parallel mmap-backed expert repacking reduces end-to-end
  load time from roughly 10--11 minutes to about 4.5 minutes on the 40 GiB A100
  proof host.
- The same source passed an initial adaptive-cache gate with
  `--moe-cache auto -ot 'exps=CPU'`: a cold France request and a subsequent
  Germany request both generated correct answers, at 5.60 and 5.74 t/s
  respectively. GPU residency rose from roughly 7.8 GiB without the cache to
  9.34 GiB after the two requests, confirming that the native canonical expert
  roots participate in runtime promotion rather than merely falling through to
  host execution. The wider cache mode, budget, eviction, and multi-GPU matrix
  remains pending.
- Native MTP now passes initialization and generation against the same source.
  Its first production gate generated the correct `Paris.` answer at 8.00 t/s,
  drafting 48 tokens and accepting 26. The gate exposed a backend-contract seam
  in the MTP `e_proj+h_proj` projection: DeepSeek's hyper-connection streams
  presented a 3-D activation to the otherwise valid block-FP8 2-D projection.
  Flattening the independent stream/token axes for that matmul and restoring
  the hidden layout afterward preserves the broadcasted numerical operation
  while making the existing scaled-FP8 executor applicable. The same shape fix
  is applied to Qwen4's equivalent hyper-connection MTP projection.
- A native-source VBR invocation also initializes and generates coherently
  (`Germany` -> `Berlin`), but it does not constitute a dynamic-tier proof.
  The existing DeepSeek-V4 cache explicitly pins its concatenated raw/CSA/HCA
  children to static `q8_0` under `-ctk/-ctv vbr`; runtime logging names the
  missing contract as per-child tier ganging. Native loading reaches the same
  documented fallback as GGUF. Dynamic DeepSeek-V4 VBR remains a runtime-cache
  project rather than an importer defect or completed release gate.
- Partial dense-layer offload also crosses the native source/backend seam
  successfully. With `-ngl 20 -ot 'exps=CPU'`, 20/45 layers occupied a
  3700.14 MiB CUDA model buffer and the remaining weights occupied
  145080.18 MiB of pinned host storage. The mixed CUDA/CPU graph initialized,
  executed prompt and decode tokens through the block-FP8 CPU path, returned
  finite coherent reasoning text, and tore down cleanly. At roughly 0.21 t/s
  this is a placement-correctness proof, not a useful serving configuration.
- The official DeepSeek source now passes both four-GPU placement modes on RTX
  3090s with routed experts held in host memory. Layer split placed 1765.35,
  1653.95, 1633.68, and 2365.33 MiB of model data on the four devices. Tensor
  split held 3547.37 MiB in the meta model buffer and used 4387 MiB per device
  after context/compute allocation. Both generated the exact one-word answer
  `Paris`; the short decode probes measured 3.49 and 5.39 t/s respectively.
  The tensor-split gate found two shared runtime defects rather than an importer
  byte error: source-less `ARANGE` was not classified as mirrored by the meta
  backend, and DeepSeek's block-FP8 Q-B, grouped output, and shared-expert scale
  grids were mirrored instead of sharded along their weights' block axes. The
  focused synthetic DeepSeek architecture test now passes the complete CUDA,
  CPU, and meta-device graph with NMSE `8.71e-08` on CUDA/meta versus CPU.
  One non-fatal checkpoint-publication warning remains on the production tensor-
  split request; checkpoint persistence under tensor split is not claimed by
  this gate.
- Four-GPU adaptive expert caching also consumes the native MXFP4 expert roots
  directly. `auto` selected three-way expert parallelism and allocated 18.09,
  20.46, 20.48, and 19.75 GiB pools. Five cold/warm requests generated correct
  answers or coherent code; repeated code decode rose from 8.11 to 9.25 t/s.
  Clean teardown reported 86.3--87.4% residency-probe hits, 16,521 successful
  fills, and zero fill, dispatch, or collection failures. Explicit `on` also
  passed with two concurrently active slots: both slots completed their short
  reasoning probes at 5.67 t/s each, with 5,296 successful fills and zero fill,
  dispatch, or collection failures. A 4096 MiB/device fixed-budget arm filled
  all four 962-slot pools, produced the same coherent quicksort twice, warmed
  decode from 6.37 to 6.93 t/s, and performed 30 replacements without a cache
  failure. This proves `auto`, `on`, expert-parallel operation, fixed budgets,
  replacement, and multi-slot execution; cache-aware `soft` placement remains
  a separate fit gate.
- The same regression pass restored the legacy `llama_model_init_from_user()`
  callback contract. Callback-backed models synthesize the canonical tensor
  requests because their GGUF metadata is not a complete tensor manifest;
  strict describe/bind/load completeness remains exclusive to real tensor
  sources. This also restores compilation and execution of the architecture
  fixture after the tensor-source interface addition.
- The text-only Qwen4 fixture at revision
  `d49cb5156b0dad4016f33b55e142a390da88e9fa` exercises recurrent attention,
  QSA/indexer splitting, PLE, hyper-connections, separate-expert aggregation,
  and the existing Qwen4 CUDA graph. Its native source path and an independent
  F32 GGUF conversion produced the same 16-token greedy continuation. This
  proof found and fixed a reversed grouped-to-tiled V-head permutation, a
  GGUF-only PLE shape probe, two production PLE dimension assumptions, and
  incorrect canonical indexer suffixes.
- The official Qwen4 FP8 source at revision
  `236dfdf285828023ca3bcd3f37366c58a3469b13` now passes a full four-GPU
  layer-split load with its routed experts and 128-shard PLE table in host
  memory. The source contains 75,264 block-FP8 tensors. Its PLE embedding is a
  raw F8 table plus one mandatory parent scale, so the native path keeps the
  51-GiB table in F8, gathers directly, and applies the scale afterward instead
  of expanding it to F32. Mapped shard upload reduced end-to-end load time from
  11:41 to 10:28 on the proof host. Pure Qwen4 row/column permutations retain
  BF16, while numerical transforms and the CUDA SSM convolution kernel retain
  their required F32 contract; focused fixtures pin all three cases. Final
  model buffers were 1945.82, 1735.39, 1883.13, and 2664.95 MiB on CUDA plus
  167040.86 MiB in pinned host memory. With the cache disabled, deterministic
  probes returned `Paris` and `Berlin` at 16.2--16.5 prompt t/s and 8.3--8.7
  decode t/s. Teardown released all device and host allocations; it also logged
  a non-fatal pre-existing compute-buffer expectation mismatch, so accounting
  silence is not claimed by this gate.
- Qwen4's checkpoint stores each routed expert as a separate 128x128-block-FP8
  matrix, while the current portable `MUL_MAT_ID`, CPU-offload, and MoE-cache
  contract requires one canonical 3-D allocation root without a block-scale
  sidecar. The bounded bridge therefore converts each expert independently to
  `Q8_0_G128`: 8.125 bpw versus 8.001 source bpw (+1.55%), with no whole-model
  duplicate. A two-expert fixture verifies independent values and scale-grid
  orientation. This is a portability bridge, not a fidelity result: the added
  requantization requires reference KLD before production acceptance, and an
  exact block-FP8 `MUL_MAT_ID` path remains a possible later optimization.
- The canonical `Q8_0_G128` expert bridge now participates in adaptive caching.
  The cache admission allowlist and both its dedicated and fused dispatch
  switches accept the type; the underlying MMVQ type traits and dot product
  were already shared with ordinary execution. On the official Qwen source,
  `--moe-cache 4096 --moe-cache-expert-parallel auto` resolved on and allocated
  2,579 slots on each of four RTX 3090s. The first 64-token quicksort request
  generated coherent code at 14.95 t/s; an identical warm request produced the
  same bytes at 23.01 t/s. Eight repeated merge-sort probes then forced 96--135
  replacements per device while sustaining 22.44--23.45 t/s. All four devices
  reported zero fill, dispatch, and collection failures.
- Tensor split exposed two independent Meta-backend enumeration gaps in the
  cache integration. Admission inspected only the top-level Meta device instead
  of its physical children, and session creation accepted only top-level CUDA
  backends even though the scheduler supplies one Meta backend. Both sites now
  use the public Meta child-enumeration APIs and deduplicate physical devices.
  On the official Qwen source, `-sm tensor -ts 1,1,1,1 -np 2` resolved the cache
  on, created one 4,092-MiB/2,579-slot `Q8_0_G128` pool on each RTX 3090, and
  served two simultaneous slots coherently. A warm concurrent probe returned
  `Paris` and a correct factorial implementation while all devices performed
  replacements; fill, dispatch, and collection failures remained zero. This
  closes the tensor-split and multi-slot cache execution gate, not a throughput
  comparison against layer split.
- Embedded MTP now passes the official-source gate after merging the shared-MTP
  runtime work from master. The direct importer reports 48 trunk layers, 49
  total layers, and one NextN layer; all 3,101 `mtp.*` source tensors (2.513
  GiB) are consumed instead of reported unused. MTP increases model residency
  by about 2.55 GiB (2,437.5 MiB host plus 169.7 MiB on CUDA3), proving that the
  173-GiB trunk is not duplicated. The target graph has 7,703 nodes and the
  separately constructed MTP context has 166 nodes. A deterministic quicksort
  request generated coherent code at 14.02 t/s with 72/72 drafts accepted; a
  prose request exercised recurrent rollback with 96/189 drafts accepted and
  remained coherent. A focused registry fixture separately pins the NextN norm,
  concatenated `eh_proj`, and `mtp.layers.0` mappings. Four-GPU tensor split
  also constructs the 166-node MTP graph through Meta and produces byte-identical
  quicksort output with the same 72/72 acceptance. It decodes at 10.04 t/s and
  falls back to the CPU sampler, so this is a placement/correctness proof rather
  than a tensor-split performance result.
- The production Qwen4 multimodal source path now reuses the existing Qwen3-VL
  vision runtime directly from the same safetensors directory passed to `-m`
  and `--mmproj`; it does not create a temporary GGUF. The adapter consumed all
  333 official vision sources into 334 canonical tensors (the temporal patch
  kernel becomes two existing Conv2D weights), kept ordinary vision tensors in
  BF16, and converted only the position table to F32 for the existing dynamic
  interpolation contract. On the official source, a real-image gate encoded
  the 300-token image batch in 671 ms and correctly identified the July 21,
  1969 New York Times Apollo 11 front page. A separate text-only invocation
  initialized the unchanged text graph, produced coherent deterministic
  reasoning, and tore down cleanly. The subsequent bullets record the completed
  cache-aware `soft` placement, VBR, long-context, and KLD gates. The tiny
  fixture remains an architecture/transform proof rather than a quality model.
- Fidelity gates now use an opt-in exact-reference form of the existing
  perplexity/KLD artifact (`LLAMA_KLD_EXACT_BASE=1`). The legacy upstream
  artifact quantizes every vocabulary log-probability to 16 bits and therefore
  produces a deterministic self-comparison floor around `1e-5`; that floor is
  serialization error, not evidence that two forward passes differ. The exact
  form stores the scored F32 logits, remains backward-compatible with legacy
  artifacts, and short-circuits byte-identical distributions to bitwise-zero
  per-position KLD. An independent DeepSeek BF16 anchor passed with all 127 raw
  values exactly `+0.0f`; the independent Qwen4 BF16 anchor did the same.
- The bounded Qwen4 `Q8_0_G128` expert-bridge comparison is measured rather
  than assumed lossless. Against the exact BF16 reference its 127-position
  slice had median KLD `6.8e-5`, mean `0.004827`, maximum `0.07359`, and
  98.425% same-top tokens. Mean PPL was effectively unchanged (`1.47886`
  versus `1.48040`), but the heavy KLD tail means this is not a near-zero
  bridge result and must remain visible in the release-quality decision.
- Against that exact BF16 GGUF reference, the official DeepSeek4 source is
  numerically indistinguishable at the 256-token acceptance depth: 122/127
  positions were bitwise zero, the remaining five had maximum KLD `1.389e-8`,
  median `0`, and same-top-token rate `100%`. This closes the bounded native-
  source reference-fidelity gate for the retained MXFP4 expert and block-FP8
  projection path.
- DeepSeek4 also passed a 5,689-token production prompt with explicit host
  experts, `--moe-cache soft`, and dynamic-VBR syntax. As designed, its coupled
  cache reported the existing static-`q8_0` fallback. Runtime soft pools landed
  at 9,872/11,776/11,815/11,075 MiB against grants of
  9,879/11,785/11,823/11,081 MiB, generated the correct sentence about Du Fu's
  influence on Japanese literature, and tore down with 75.9--76.9% cache hits,
  10,498 fills, 18 replacements, and zero fill/dispatch/collection failures.
  This proves the runtime soft-budget policy under explicit host-expert
  placement; the unpinned cache-aware placement result follows.
- The unpinned DeepSeek4 cache-aware soft solve is now complete. It kept one of
  44 routed-expert layers resident, evicted 137,088 of 140,352 MiB, and projected
  41,753 MiB of cache capacity. Runtime live-memory grants were
  1,883/14,287/14,287/14,287 MiB and the corresponding pools landed at
  1,878/14,280/14,280/14,280 MiB. The runtime total safely exceeded the dry
  projection because the fit also withholds its normal per-device fit margins;
  every pool remained below its live grant. Generation returned `Paris`, all
  fills completed without fill/dispatch/collection failures, and teardown was
  clean.
- The production Qwen4 dynamic-VBR gate is complete. A 17,445-token prompt plus
  512 decode tokens at a deliberately constrained 184-MiB mapped-physical KV
  budget exercised 41 live tier transitions across all four GPUs: every
  attention KV layer first moved from f16 to turbo8, followed by selected
  turbo8-to-turbo4 transitions as the sequence grew. The four device budgets
  were 47.14/45.62/45.62/45.62 MiB within 124/120/120/120-MiB VMM pools. The
  run remained coherent, completed at 212.2 prompt tokens/s and 10.0 generation
  tokens/s, reported no reserve, allocation, or CUDA failure, and tore down
  cleanly at 17,956 resident tokens.
- That gate also found and closed a multi-GPU FLA integration defect before the
  accepted run: the embedded gated-delta-net module/function cache was keyed
  only by compute capability even though CUDA modules are context-scoped. A
  module first loaded on CUDA0 was therefore an invalid handle on CUDA1. The
  cache is now keyed by device and architecture; the exact production-shaped
  `GATED_DELTA_NET` backend case passes sequentially on CUDA0 through CUDA3 in
  one process, and the complete four-GPU Qwen4 run above provides the model-level
  proof.
- The unpinned Qwen4 cache-aware soft solve is complete. Starting from a fully
  overcommitted 130,445-MiB projection, the per-device fitter selected a
  partial-eviction layout with 5/49 routed-expert layers resident, evicted
  104,812 of 117,000 MiB, retained 12,187 MiB, and projected 64,296 MiB of cache
  capacity (55.0% coverage). The first real request measured live grants of
  80/22,152/22,152/22,152 MiB. CUDA0 correctly declined to create an undersized
  pool, while CUDA1--3 each allocated 22,148 MiB, four MiB below its grant. The
  66,444-MiB live total safely exceeds the dry projection because the fit also
  withholds its normal per-device margins. Generation returned `Paris`; all
  three active pools completed eight fills with zero fill, dispatch, or
  collection failures, and teardown was clean.

## 7. Test matrix

### Structural tests

- Canonical tensor request set comes solely from the existing model loader.
- Every requested tensor binds exactly once.
- Every required source quant weight has all required auxiliaries.
- No architecture adapter duplicates a complete target manifest.
- GGUF construction and loading do not enter safetensors code.

### Correctness tests

- Registry bounds, gaps, overlaps, duplicate names, dtype sizes, and shard-index validation.
- Quant rule declaration order and anchored regex behavior.
- Per-format scale shape/dtype/value checks.
- Architecture transform fixtures with known row/column indices.
- Direct projection comparison for all retained kernel shapes.
- Greedy coherent-generation smoke tests.
- Reference-vs-reference anchor exactly zero.
- Safetensors-versus-reference KLD near zero with the tolerance and reference named explicitly.
- Full KLD/hazard testing whenever a numerical representation or kernel changes.

### Placement and backend tests

- Single CUDA GPU.
- CUDA layer split and tensor split.
- Partial CPU offload.
- Large-MoE `--cpu-moe`, `--n-cpu-moe`, and every retained `--moe-cache`
  policy, including expert-parallel caching on multiple GPUs.
- CPU-only or a precise early rejection for unsupported formats.
- HIP/RDNA or a precise early rejection for unsupported formats.

- Peak VRAM after load.
- PP at representative batch sizes.
- TG at short and deep context.
- Kernel-level comparison against the corresponding GGUF/runtime type.
- External-engine comparison only under equivalent model, quant contract, device count, batching, graph mode, and sampling behavior.

## 8. Review checkpoints

Run a focused design/code review after Phases 2, 3, and 6.

Questions reviewers must answer:

1. Is tensor topology declared in more than one place?
2. Can a quant adapter be reused by another architecture without including Qwen code?
3. Can an architecture adapter accidentally alter backend selection after the tensor becomes canonical?
4. Are all correctness-critical scale and permutation contracts mandatory?
5. Does any fallback silently change numerical format or placement?
6. Does the GGUF hot path perform new virtual dispatch, mapping, or source-format checks?
7. Is the source/importer lifetime valid until the final upload and all asynchronous copies complete?
8. Can cancellation or an exception leave partially registered/repacked tensor state behind?

## 9. Recommended next order

Current checkpoint (2026-09-02):

- the architecture bridge, bounded loader, quant adapters, and simplification
  pass are committed in reviewable units;
- native adapters for `LLM_ARCH_QWEN4EXP` and `LLM_ARCH_DEEPSEEK4` load their
  official sources through the existing model implementations;
- both large MoEs have passed bounded production loads, coherent generation,
  layer split, tensor split, and partial CPU/expert placement;
- adaptive expert caching has passed `auto`, explicit `on`, fixed-budget,
  replacement, multi-slot, and multi-GPU expert-parallel execution;
- native MTP has passed production generation for both architectures, including
  Qwen4 layer/tensor split and DeepSeek hyper-connection projection; and
- Qwen4 multimodal loading now consumes the official embedded vision tower
  directly from safetensors and has passed real-image generation plus the
  independent text-only regression; and
- the remaining work below is acceptance and integration work, not another
  importer architecture rewrite.

The multimodal gate, bounded DeepSeek4 production matrix, exact Qwen4 BF16
reference artifact, independent zero anchor, bounded Q8 bridge comparison,
Qwen4 long-context dynamic-VBR gate, and Qwen4 cache-aware soft-fit gate are
complete. The five-step large-MoE acceptance tranche is closed; proceed to the
broader release matrix below.

DeepSeek4 reference KLD, long-context generation, teardown, and the explicit
host-expert soft-cache runtime are already closed. Dynamic DeepSeek4 VBR remains
a separately identified runtime-cache project until per-child tier ganging is
implemented; native safetensors reaches the same explicit static-`q8_0` fallback
as GGUF.

Next release work:

1. run the representative Qwen3.8-27B acceptance matrix from Phase 0, including
   exact-zero anchors, reference KLD, coherent generation, resident VRAM, peak
   host memory, PP, and TG;
2. profile native-directory loading on cold and warm page caches, explain the
   BF16 A100 load-time gap against equivalent GGUF and vLLM loads, and remove
   material duplicate scans, conversions, or uploads before release;
3. finish the retained real-machine/backend matrix: CPU-only or precise early
   rejection, HIP or precise early rejection, cancellation, and teardown;
4. freeze reproducible commands and baselines for BF16, NVFP4, FP8, W8A8,
   BitsAndBytes, and normal/act-order GPTQ;
5. close only measured material kernel gaps, including compact W4A16 prompt
   processing, without introducing a second resident weight copy;
6. publish a user-facing format/backend/architecture support matrix, invocation
   examples, memory behavior, performance baselines, and precise limitations;
   and
7. widen the architecture bridge only when a real checkpoint proves the
   canonical name/layout mapping.

Post-release, in priority order:

1. implement and prove ModelOpt W4A4 NVFP4 activation execution on Blackwell;
2. replace correctness-first BitsAndBytes and act-order GPTQ paths only where
   profiling demonstrates a worthwhile performance gap;
3. add optimized HIP executors for formats that have demonstrated user demand;
4. add new architectures only from real checkpoint fixtures; and
5. consider EXL3 or unusual WNA16 widths only as separately scoped projects.

## 10. Definition of done

This architecture project is complete when:

- Qwen3.5 safetensors no longer maintains a parallel tensor manifest;
- format-generic quant code is absent from the Qwen adapter;
- Qwen3.8-27B, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next/Qwen4, and DeepSeek-V4-Flash load native
  safetensors through their existing model classes;
- equivalent GGUF and safetensors tensors reach the same backend kernels;
- unsupported format/backend combinations fail before large allocations;
- no temporary GGUF or whole-model duplicate is created;
- every format in the Qwen3.8 release boundary has a pinned, reproducible
  correctness, KLD, memory, PP, and TG record;
- single-GPU, split, offload, and unsupported-backend behavior is documented and
  proven rather than inferred;
- both large MoEs pass layer/tensor split plus CPU-expert and adaptive-cache
  gates without changing their canonical expert ownership;
- correctness, KLD, placement, load-memory, PP, and TG gates pass; and
- adding a third already-supported architecture demonstrably requires only metadata/name/layout policy unless it introduces a genuinely new operation or quantization format.

Status 2026-09-04: the importer now serves a fused Q|K|V projection for attention layers
(`LLAMA_SAFETENSORS_FUSE_QKV=0` disables): AWQ 60→62 t/s, W8A16 44.6→46.2 t/s, fidelity unchanged.
A recurrent qkv|z fusion gave no gain and was dropped. Remaining decode gap to vLLM is the
per-layer launch count in the recurrent block and the output head.

Status 2026-09-05: decode pass — paired Q4 gate|up, cuBLAS output head, conv-state fusion landed
(AWQ 65.9 vs vLLM 71.0 t/s, W8A16 46.4 vs 48.7 on a clean A100). Recurrent qkv|z fusion is opt-in
(`LLAMA_SAFETENSORS_FUSE_QKVZ=1`) until its W8A16 micro-batch fidelity shift is localized.

Status 2026-09-06: decode pass 2 — alias-safe BF16 retention, gated-RMS fusion, gate kernel split,
prepare pairs kernel (Astra); async input uploads, width-general conv-state kernel with SSM_CONV+SiLU
folded in, qkv|z fused by default, multi-rope rope+set_rows fusion (Fable). 822 launches/token.
AWQ 69.96 t/s and W8A16 48.39 t/s on a clean A100-80GB against vLLM 71.0 / 48.7; KLD identical to
the unfused graph at every width.
